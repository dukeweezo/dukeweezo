Hello! I'm an generalizing specialist, with interests including:

`functional languages, well-done OOP, language design, architecture (software), low-level programming (C to assembly), front-end / back-end development, web development, UI design, game engine architecture, game scripting, game design, graphic design, 3d modelling (Maya), architecture (buildings [classical, Italian Renaissance]), mazes, board game design, ecology, wildlife biology, the sport involving kicking a âš½`

As a creator of technology, I believe in
- exhaustively considering all social impact before creating and releasing a product or technology
- not ignoring negative social impacts just because something is lucrative, 'cutting-edge', 'cool', 'a challenge', or because 'someone else will end up doing it anyway'
