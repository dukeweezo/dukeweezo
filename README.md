Things I'm interested in include:

`functional languages, language design, architecture (software), low-level programming, UI design, GIS, video game design, 3d modelling (Maya), architecture (buildings [classical, Italian Renaissance]), board game design, ecology, the sport involving kicking a âš½`

As a creator of technology, I believe in
- exhaustively considering all social impact before creating and releasing a product or technology
- not ignoring negative social impacts just because something is lucrative, cutting-edge, 'cool', a challenge, or because 'someone else will end up doing it anyway'
